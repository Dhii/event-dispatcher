Event Dispatcher
==============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Dhii/event-dispatcher-interface.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/Dhii/event-dispatcher-interface)
[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/dhii/event-dispatcher-interface/version)](https://packagist.org/packages/dhii/event-dispatcher-interface)

Enhancements to PSR-14.

## Details
This is a fork of the original [event-dispatcher][] PSR package. The aim was to make it compatible with PHP 7.0,
but now this package has evolved and is instead aimed to enhance the interfaces of [PSR-14][],
which this package is fully compatible with.
